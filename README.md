## About me

I'm a child of a multicultural journey. Born in Venezuela to a family of engineers and economists, I grew up in Spain to study pure maths in university and moved to Poland to become a self-taught programmer. After a few years as a C developer in security/telecommunication domains, I'm now an Erlang senior with an emphasis on performance and security.

In my free time I'm a sports addict, I have a black belt in Karate, which I practiced from early childhood until my mid 20s, now practicing mainly yoga. I traveled by bike most of Western and Central Europe, and I'm also a history fanboy, history is the hobby I don't get paid for.

See [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nelson-vides/) for more information about me.
